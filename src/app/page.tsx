                Recent advances in agents‚Äîautonomous, goal-driven AI systems
                that iteratively observe, act, and learn from their
                environments‚Äîoffer a fundamentally different approach from
                traditional AI models that passively respond to input. These
                agentic AI systems are rapidly reshaping how we approach
                data-intensive tasks and providing new opportunities for the VIS
                community. Imagine an agent autonomously generating
                visualizations to analyze complex data, discovering patterns
                collaboratively, testing hypotheses, and communicating visual
                insights at a speed and scale beyond human capability. Yet, the
                emergence of these powerful systems raises critical questions
                that the VIS community must address: Could autonomous agents
                eventually replace human data scientists, and if not, how might
                they best collaborate? Are current visualization techniques and
                interfaces, originally designed for human analysts, suitable for
                agent interactions? How can VIS designers effectively integrate
                agents into their workflows without compromising human agency?
                And to what extent should agents help shape and educate the next
                generation of visualization researchers?

                Through a mix of keynote talks, paper presentations, and a
                mini-challenge, this workshop invites researchers and
                practitioners to share innovative ideas, explore these
                questions, and discuss strategies to transform the impact of VIS
                for a future where human and AI agents co-exist.
