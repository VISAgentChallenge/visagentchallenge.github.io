                Recent advances in agents‚Äîautonomous, goal-driven AI systems that iteratively
                observe, act, and learn from their environments‚Äîoffer a fundamentally different
                approach from traditional AI models that passively respond to input. These agentic
                AI systems are rapidly reshaping how we approach data-intensive tasks and providing
                new opportunities for the VIS community. 
                {/* Imagine an agent autonomously generating
                visualizations to analyze complex data, discovering patterns collaboratively,
                testing hypotheses, and communicating visual insights at a speed and scale beyond
                human capability. Yet, the emergence of these powerful systems raises critical
                questions that the VIS community must address: Could autonomous agents eventually
                replace human data scientists, and if not, how might they best collaborate? Are
                current visualization techniques and interfaces, originally designed for human
                analysts, suitable for agent interactions? How can VIS designers effectively
                integrate agents into their workflows without compromising human agency? And to what
                extent should agents help shape and educate the next generation of visualization
                researchers?

                  participants to build on the existing template by developing agents with improved
                  reasoning and coordination strategies. The objective is to generate more
                  insightful, coherent, and visually compelling analyses of the provided dataset, in
                  the form of a data visualization report.
